// NOTES (tested on chrome 54)
// - When you add an existing object to 2 arrays, you get the size of one.
// - It does not matter (time and memory) if you add objects to an object or push to an array.
// - Iterating over 1.000.000 keys in an object, takes 200ms.
// - Iterating an array of 1.000.000 objects, takes 2ms (100x faster).
// - Direct acces of an property in an object, takes 0.02ms (100x faster).

// Conclusions
// - Store all IStoreObjects, on one big object index, for direct access
// - Use arrays as indexes, that refer to the objects on the object index, when you want to loop and group.
// e.g.
// - objectIndex is an object and contains all objects.
// - typeIndex is an object that contains keys foreach type.
//      each values contains an array of references to the objects on the objectIndex of type x.
// So now we can always access objects directly by its id, but we can also get all objects of type x.
